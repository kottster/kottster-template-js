# Kottster App

## Development server

**You can start the development server with the following command**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server on [http://localhost:5480](http://localhost:5480) or a different port if 5480 is already in use.

## Deploying

**You need to build the app before deploying it. Run the following command**:

```
npm run build
```

This compiles the app and stores it in the `build` directory. 

**Once built, you can start the app in production mode:**

```
npm run start
```
